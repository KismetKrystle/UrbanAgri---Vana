Retrieving, Analyzing and Summarizing world Data to improve our understanding of the community conditions and generate customized urban Farming solutions for the particular area.

We built our project using [MultiBaas](https://docs.curvegrid.com/multibaas/) to handle the complexities of interacting with an EVM smart contract. File name: UrbanAgri_Curve

Smart Contracts are set to be deployed on the Vana Moksha Testnet (network was down at the time of testing and also currently incompatible with deploying on CurveGrid), in the future our DLP will be searchable at https://moksha.vanascan.io 

The repository consists of two sub-projects:

- The `**blockchain**` folder contains a [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) project that uses the [Hardhat MultiBaas Plugin](https://github.com/curvegrid/hardhat-multibaas-plugin) to compile the `UrbanAgriDLP` smart contract, deploy it to the network, and link it to a MultiBaas deployment so that we can interact with it via the REST API.
- The `frontend` folder contains a Next.js web application that provides a UI for interacting with the smart contract using the [MultiBaas SDK](https://github.com/curvegrid/multibaas-sdk-typescript).
